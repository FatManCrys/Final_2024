# Introduction

A new  preventative vaccine (covid921) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups by gender( guys and gals), drug use, and sexual orientation. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine. Structure your report in four sections each devoted to one of the four subgroups, use null and alternative hypothesis statements and correct statistical verbage when referencing p-values in conclusions.

## Males

### Summary of Males

```{r}
male_summary <- Male %>%
  group_by(treatment, infected) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = infected, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)
male_summary <- male_summary %>%
  mutate(total = rowSums(select(., -treatment)))
male_column_totals <- male_summary %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>%
  mutate(treatment = "Total")
male_summary <- bind_rows(male_summary, male_column_totals)
male_summary
```

the summary of males shows that the total males are 18392, 355 of the males have covid whilst 18037 are fine so lets make a visual representation of it with a barplot.

### Visual Results

```{r}
# Bar plot

# Summarize the data for Males by infection status and treatment
male_summary_data <- Male %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
male_plot_count <- ggplot(male_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
male_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Males Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Males") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
male_plot_percent <- ggplot(male_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
male_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Males Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Males") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

these barplots show us the number of males infected with covid, obvoiusly the males with the vaccine have less covid than the placebo but the results are very much close to eachother but to truly see the results we need a diffrent graph.

### Numerical Results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Male)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The results show that among the infected males, 73.80% had taken the placebo, and 26.2% had taken the vaccine. For the healthy males, 50.01% had taken the placebo, and 49.99% had taken the vaccine. Overall, 2.82% of males who took the placebo got COVID, compared to 1.02% of those who took the vaccine. This shows that the vaccine helps reduce the chances of getting COVID. These results suggest that the vaccine is effective in lowering COVID infection rates in males, and we can support this by looking at the bar plots.

### Inferential Results
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
Malefish <- fisher.test(table1)
Malefish
```


The key result is Fisher's Exact Test, with a very small p-value (𝑝=2.2×10−16p=2.2×10 −16) or 0.00000000000000022. This means the differences in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups are very unlikely to be random. Because of this, we reject the null hypothesis, which assumes infection rates don't depend on the treatment. The odds ratio of about 2.82 shows that males who got the vaccine were nearly 2.8 times more likely to get COVID compared to those who got the placebo. These results suggest the vaccine is ineffective at preventing COVID in males.

```{r}
male_effect <- Malefish$p.value / (Malefish$p.value + 1)
effectiveness_male <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$estimate) * 100
print(effectiveness_male)

male_low <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$conf.int[1]) * 100
male_hi <- (1 - 1 / Malefish$conf.int[2]) * 100
options(digits = 2)

male_low
male_hi
```

### `r effectiveness_male`% Effectiveness with Confidence Interval: `r male_low`%  to `r male_hi`%

The vaccine's effectiveness in males is above 50%, which suggests it is effective. With a calculated effectiveness of 64.48% and a confidence interval ranging from 54.75% to 72.32%, we can confidently conclude that the vaccine helps reduce infection rates among males.

The null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) proposed that the vaccine has no effect on infection rates, while the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) suggested it does. Based on the very small p-value from Fisher's Exact Test and an odds ratio of 2.82, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative. This supports the conclusion that the vaccine is effective in lowering infection rates in males.

The odds ratio shows that males who received the vaccine were nearly 2.8 times more likely to avoid contracting COVID compared to those who took the placebo. The confidence interval, ranging from 54.75% to 72.32%, further strengthens this finding, confirming the vaccine's significant protective effect.


## Females

### Summary of Females

```{r}
female_summary <- Female %>% 
  group_by(treatment, infected) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = infected, values_from = count, values_fill = 0) 
female_summary <- female_summary %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(select(., -treatment))) 
female_column_totals <- female_summary %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = "Total") 
female_summary <- bind_rows(female_summary, female_column_totals) 
female_summary 
```


There are 18328 females. 365 have covid while 17963 are OK. and 237 have placebo This isn't enough to show a trend so now let us add a barplot for a visual representation 

### Visual Results

```{r}
# Bar plot

# Summarize the data for Females by infection status and treatment
female_summary_data <- Female %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
female_plot_count <- ggplot(female_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
female_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Females Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Females") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "magenta")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
female_plot_percent <- ggplot(female_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
female_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Females Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Females") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "magenta")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The bar plots above illustrate the number of females infected with COVID-19. Visually, it appears that females who received the vaccine have a lower incidence of COVID-19 compared to those who received the placebo. However, the results for both groups are quite close in both graphs. Although there seems to be a visual difference, we need to perform a statistical analysis to determine if this difference is significant.

### Numerical Results
```{r}
table2 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Female)
rowPerc(table2)
colPerc(table2)
```

The numerical results reveal that among the infected females, 65% had received the placebo, while 35% had received the vaccine. Among those who were not infected, 50% had taken the placebo and 50% had taken the vaccine. Overall, 2.6% of females on the placebo contracted COVID-19 compared to 1.4% on the vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine reduces infection rates. These findings indicate that the vaccine is effective in lowering COVID-19 rates in females, which is consistent with the bar plots demonstrating the vaccine's effectiveness.

### Inferential Results
```{r}
chisq.test(table2)
chisqtestGC(table2)
Femalefish <- fisher.test(table2)
Femalefish
```


The key result to consider is Fisher's Exact Test, which yielded an extremely small p-value (𝑝=1×10−8p=1×10 −8) or 0.00000001, suggesting that the observed differences in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups are highly unlikely to be due to chance. This leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, which assumed that infection rates were independent of the treatment. The odds ratio of approximately 1.9 indicates that females who received the vaccine were nearly 1.9 times more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to those who received the placebo. These findings imply that the vaccine is ineffective at preventing COVID-19 in females.

```{r}
# Calculate effectiveness
female_effect <- Femalefish$p.value / (Femalefish$p.value + 1)
effectiveness_female <- (1 - 1 / Femalefish$estimate) * 100
print(effectiveness_female)

# Calculate effectiveness confidence interval
female_low <- (1 - 1 / Femalefish$conf.int[1]) * 100
female_hi <- (1 - 1 / Femalefish$conf.int[2]) * 100
options(digits = 2)

#print 
female_low
female_hi
```

### `r effectiveness_female`% Effectiveness with Confidence Interval: `r female_low`%  to `r female_hi`%

The above analysis examines the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine in females. If the vaccine's effectiveness exceeds 50%, it would be considered effective. However, with a calculated effectiveness of 46.13% and a confidence interval ranging from 32.79% to 56.98%, we conclude that the vaccine is ineffective in reducing infection rates among females.

The null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) assumed the vaccine had no effect on infection rates, while the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) suggested the vaccine reduces infection rates. Given the extremely small p-value from Fisher’s Exact Test and an odds ratio of 1.9, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative, confirming that the vaccine does not significantly reduce infection rates in females.

The odds ratio shows that females who received the vaccine were nearly 1.9 times more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to those who received the placebo. The confidence interval, with a 95% range between 32.79% and 56.98%, further indicates that the vaccine’s impact on females is limited.


## LGBTQ -> Gay

### Summary of Gay
```{r}
gay_summary <- Gay %>%
  group_by(treatment, infected) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = infected, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)
gay_summary <- gay_summary %>%
  mutate(total = rowSums(select(., -treatment)))
gay_column_totals <- gay_summary %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>%
  mutate(treatment = "Total")
gay_summary <- bind_rows(gay_summary, gay_column_totals)
gay_summary
```

This is the given information so far for the gays. There are 3060 gays. 60 have covid while 3000 are OK. This isn't enough to show a trend so now let us add a barplot for a visual representation.

### Visual Results
```{r}
# Bar plot

# Summarize the data for Gay by infection status and treatment
gay_summary_data <- Gay %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
gay_plot_count <- ggplot(gay_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
gay_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Gay Individuals Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Individuals") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "yellow")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
gay_plot_percent <- ggplot(gay_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
gay_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Gay Individuals Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Individuals") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "yellow")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The bar plots above display the number of gay individuals infected with COVID-19. Visually, it appears that those who received the vaccine have fewer infections compared to the placebo group. While the difference seems quite noticeable, a statistical analysis is needed to determine if the difference is statistically significant.

### Numerical Results
```{r}
table3 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Gay)
rowPerc(table3)
colPerc(table3)
```

The numerical results indicate that among the infected gay individuals, 80% had received the placebo, while 20% had received the vaccine. Among those who were not infected, 48% had taken the placebo, and 52% had taken the vaccine. Overall, 3.2% of gay individuals on the placebo contracted COVID-19, compared to 0.77% among those who received the vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine helps reduce infection rates. These findings imply that the vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 rates in gay individuals, which is consistent with the bar plots demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Inferential Results
```{r} 
chisq.test(table3) 
chisqtestGC(table3) 
Gayfish <- fisher.test(table3) 
Gayfish 
``` 


The key result to highlight is Fisher's Exact Test, which produced an extremely small p-value(𝑝=7×10−7p=7×10 −7) or 0.0000007, suggesting that the differences observed in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups are highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. As a result, the null hypothesis, which assumes that infection rates are independent of treatment, is rejected. The odds ratio of approximately 4.3 indicates that gay individuals who received the vaccine were nearly 4.3 times more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who received the placebo. These findings suggest that the vaccine is ineffective in preventing COVID-19 in gay individuals.

```{r}
# Calculate effectiveness
gay_effect <- Gayfish$p.value / (Gayfish$p.value + 1)
effectiveness_gay <- (1 - 1 / Gayfish$estimate) * 100
print(effectiveness_gay)

# Calculate effectiveness confidence interval
gay_low <- (1 - 1 / Gayfish$conf.int[1]) * 100
gay_hi <- (1 - 1 / Gayfish$conf.int[2]) * 100
options(digits = 2)

#print 
gay_low
gay_hi
```

### `r effectiveness_gay`% Effectiveness with Confidence Interval: `r gay_low`%  to `r gay_hi`%


The analysis above evaluates the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine for gay individuals. If the vaccine's effectiveness is above 50%, it is considered effective. With a calculated effectiveness of 76.6% and a confidence interval ranging from 55.06% to 88.74%, we can conclude that the vaccine is effective in reducing infection rates among gay individuals.

The null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) assumed that the vaccine has no effect on infection rates, while the alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)) suggested that the vaccine reduces infection rates. Based on the very small p-value from Fisher’s Exact Test and an odds ratio of 4.3, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative, confirming that the vaccine does reduce infection rates in gay individuals.

The odds ratio of 4.3 indicates that gay individuals who received the vaccine were nearly 4.3 times more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to those who received the placebo. The confidence interval further supports these findings, with a 95% range of effectiveness between 55.06% and 88.74%, underscoring the vaccine's significant protective effect for gay individuals.

## Druggies -> DrugUser

### Summary of DrugUser
```{r}
druguser_summary <- DrugUser %>%
  group_by(treatment, infected) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = infected, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)

# Add total column
druguser_summary <- druguser_summary %>%
  mutate(total = rowSums(select(., -treatment)))

# Add total row for each treatment
druguser_column_totals <- druguser_summary %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>%
  mutate(treatment = "Total")

# Combine the totals with the main data
druguser_summary <- bind_rows(druguser_summary, druguser_column_totals)

druguser_summary
```

Here is the information available so far for drug users: there are a total of 3060 drug users, with 60 infected with COVID-19 and 3000 who are not infected. This data alone isn't sufficient to identify a clear trend, so we will now add a bar plot for better visual representation.

### Visual Results
```{r}
# Summarize the data for DrugUser by infection status and treatment
druguser_summary_data <- DrugUser %>%
  group_by(infected, treatment) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(prcnt = count / sum(count))

# Bar plot for count of infected vs treatment
druguser_plot_count <- ggplot(druguser_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = count, fill = treatment))
druguser_plot_count + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Drug Users Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Count of Infected Drug Users") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "black")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot for percentage of infected vs treatment
druguser_plot_percent <- ggplot(druguser_summary_data, aes(x = infected, y = prcnt * 100, fill = treatment))
druguser_plot_percent + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Drug Users Infected by Treatment",
       x = "Infection Status", y = "Percentage of Infected Drug Users") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("placebo" = "gray", "vaccine" = "black")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The bar plots above display the number of drug users infected with COVID-19. Visually, it appears that drug users who received the vaccine have a higher incidence of COVID-19 compared to those who received the placebo. Although the difference looks significant, a statistical analysis is necessary to determine whether this difference is statistically significant.

### Numerical Results
```{r}
table4 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=DrugUser)
rowPerc(table4)
colPerc(table4)
```

The numerical results show that among the infected drug users, 8.3% received the placebo, while 91.7% received the vaccine. Among those who were not infected, 51.0% took the placebo, and 49.0% took the vaccine. Overall, 0.33% of drug users on the placebo contracted COVID-19, compared to 3.6% on the vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine is associated with a higher infection rate in this group. These findings imply that the vaccine may not be effective in reducing COVID-19 rates among drug users, which is consistent with the bar plots showing higher infection rates in vaccinated drug users.

### Inferential Results
```{r}
chisq.test(table4)
chisqtestGC(table4)
DrugUserfish <- fisher.test(table4)
DrugUserfish
```

The key result to highlight is Fisher's Exact Test, which yielded an extremely small p-value (𝑝=3×10−12p=3×10 −12) or 0.000000000003, suggesting that the observed differences in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups are highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. As a result, the null hypothesis, which assumes that infection rates are independent of treatment, is rejected.
